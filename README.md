# A Data-Driven Philanthropy Approach to Fund Allocation

This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates a machine learning-driven methodology to optimize fund allocation for an international NGO. The project focuses on maximizing the impact of available resources by leveraging data-driven insights.

## Project Overview

International NGOs often face challenges in distributing limited funds effectively across various regions and projects. This project provides a structured approach using machine learning techniques to:

- Identify key factors influencing fund allocation.
- Predict fund requirements based on historical data.
- Optimize resource distribution to maximize impact.

The model uses supervised learning techniques to predict the areas requiring aid and provides actionable insights for better fund allocation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing data, outliers, and performs feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes data trends and relationships between variables.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements regression-based and classification-based techniques to derive predictions.
- **Optimization Strategies:** Provides recommendations for fund allocation based on model outputs.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "A Data Driven Philanthropy Approach To Fund Allocation To Help International NGO -SarthakParashar.ipynb"
   ```

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Train machine learning models.
   - Visualize and interpret the results.

3. Modify parameters as needed to experiment with different models and configurations.
